# Rename_Photos
  A simple Python script to rename all `.jpeg`, `.jpg`, and `.png` images inside a folder with a custom prefix and a counter.
# Features
- Renames all image files in a given folder.
- Keeps the original file extension (`.jpeg`, `.jpg`, `.png`).
- Adds a custom prefix and an incremental number to each file.
- Ensures only image files are renamed.  
# How It Work
- First, move all the photos you want to rename into the folder named "Photos" in your directory.
- Then, run the program and enter the name of the folder when prompted.
# Notes
- The script will only work if the folder exists and contains image files with the correct extensions.
- It modifies the original files (make a backup if needed).
